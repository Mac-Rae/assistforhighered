# Knowledge Base WYSIWYG Package

- Jim Mackin - SalesAgility
- Version 11

## Purpose
This package replaces the WYSIWYG ("What You See Is What You Get" - a type of editor where you immediately see the visual impact of changes to formatting e.t.c.) editor in the Knowledge Base module of SuiteCRM with an updated TinyMCE Editor.

## Install
This package should be installed via the module loader section of SuiteCRM.
Once installed a Quick Repair and Rebuild should be run for the package changes to take effect.

## Use
No special action needs to be taken to use the plugin - the WYSIWYG editor in Knowledge Base can be used as before but will be a more recent version.
