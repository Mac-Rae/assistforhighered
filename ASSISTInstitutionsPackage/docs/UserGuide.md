# Institutions Package

- Jim Mackin - SalesAgility
- Version 1

## Purpose
This package adds an "Institutions" module to the CRM. Institutions are similar to Accounts but, since they server different purposes have been given their own module.

## Install
This package should be installed via the module loader section of SuiteCRM.
Once installed a Quick Repair and Rebuild should be run for the package changes to take effect. Note that the Quick Repair and Rebuild will generate database changes. Be sure to run these (at the bottom of the initial Quick Repair and Rebuild run). In addition "Repair Roles" should be ran from the Repair Menu.

The module can be added to the displayed modules, if desired, in the "Display Modules and Subpanels" menu. This will have it appear in the CRM module menu. 

Finally you may wish to setup roles or security group restrictions if some users should not be able to access, edit, e.t.c. these records.

## Use
This module can be used like any other regular CRM module. Navigating to the module screen will list the current records and records can be created, edited or deleted.
