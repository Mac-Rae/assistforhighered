# Search Header Fix

- Jim Mackin - SalesAgility
- Version 2

## Purpose
This package fixes a small core issue in SuiteCRM whereby the ElasticSearch search results page shows some system keys (such as module name and enum keys) rather than the user facing display labels that should be used.

## Install
This package should be installed via the module loader section of SuiteCRM. Once installed the changes should take effect immediately however a Quick Repair and Rebuild is usually recommended.

## Use
This package fixes a display issue - there is no usage notes.
